## Our Contribution Philosophy

We believe in a welcoming and inclusive community. Our goal is to create a space where people of all skill levels can learn, grow, and contribute. We expect all contributors to be respectful, open-minded, and collaborative. Please be kind in all your interactions.

## Your Contribution Journey

Ready to get started? Here's the path you'll take from an idea to a merged contribution.

### 1. Finding an Issue to Work On

The best place to start is our **[Issues Tab](https://github.com/shambhaveesrivastava12/ChittChat/issues)**.
* Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are specifically prepared for new contributors.
* If you have your own idea, please **open a new issue** to propose your change. This allows us to discuss the feature and make sure it aligns with the project's goals before you spend time on it.
* Once you've chosen an issue, comment on it to let us know you'd like to work on it. We'll assign it to you.

### 2. Forking & Cloning the Repository

First, you'll need your own copy of the project.
1.  **Fork** the main [ChittChat repository](https://github.com/shambhaveesrivastava12/ChittChat) to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine, replacing `<YOUR_USERNAME>`:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<YOUR_USERNAME>/ChittChat.git
    cd ChittChat
    ```

### 3. Keeping Your Fork Synced

To avoid conflicts, it's important to keep your fork's `main` branch updated with the original repository.

1.  **Add the original repository as an "upstream" remote:**
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream [https://github.com/shambhaveesrivastava12/ChittChat.git](https://github.com/shambhaveesrivastava12/ChittChat.git)
    ```
2.  **Before creating a new branch, always pull the latest changes from the upstream main branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    ```

### 4. Creating a Branch

Create a new branch for every issue you work on. This isolates your changes and makes the review process much cleaner.

> üí° **Branch Naming Convention:** We use the format `<type>/<short-description>`.
>
> * **Features:** `feat/add-dark-mode`
> * **Bug Fixes:** `fix/login-button-bug`
> * **Documentation:** `docs/update-contributing-guide`

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-cool-new-feature
```

## üöÄ Setting Up Your Local Environment

This section contains the detailed, step-by-step instructions to get ChittChat running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: v12 or higher.
-   **MongoDB**: Make sure the database service is actively running.
-   **npm** / **yarn**: Comes with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Install Backend Dependencies** (from the project's root directory):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install --prefix frontend
    ```

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The `.env` file must be created in the **ROOT** directory of the project, not inside the `backend` folder.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the project's root.
2.  Copy the following configuration into it:

    ```bash
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    NODE_ENV=development
    BREVO_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

### Running the Application

You'll need **two separate terminals**.

* **Terminal 1 (Backend Server):** In the **root** `ChittChat` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
* **Terminal 2 (Frontend Client):** In the `frontend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

Your browser should open to the Vite development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### Common Setup Errors & Fixes

* **Error:** `mongosh: command not found`
    * **Fix:** This means MongoDB's command-line tools are not in your system's PATH. You need to find your MongoDB `bin` directory and add it to your system's environment variables.
* **Error:** `The 'uri' parameter... must be a string, got "undefined"`
    * **Fix:** This is almost always an issue with your `.env` file. Double-check that:
        1.  The file is named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`).
        2.  It is located in the **ROOT** project folder.
        3.  The variable is spelled exactly `MONGO_DB_URI`.
* **Problem:** The frontend shows a blank white page.
    * **Fix:** Open your browser's developer console (Right-click > Inspect > Console). This will show you the exact JavaScript error that is preventing React from rendering.

## üíª The Art of Making Changes

### Our Coding Style

-   **Consistency is Key:** Please try to match the style and patterns you see in the existing codebase.
-   **React:** We use functional components with Hooks.
-   **JavaScript:** Prefer modern ES6+ syntax (e.g., `const`/`let`, arrow functions, destructuring).
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Use theme values where possible and add new styles in a way that is consistent with the existing UI.

### Writing Excellent Commit Messages

We use the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** standard. This helps us maintain a clear and searchable git history.

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
* `<scope>` is optional.

**Examples:**
* `feat: Add emoji picker to chat input`
* `fix(auth): Correct password validation error`
* `docs: Update local setup instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md`
* `style(sidebar): Reformat component with Prettier`
* `refactor: Simplify message sending logic`
* `chore: Upgrade emoji-picker-react to latest version`

## ‚úÖ Submitting Your Pull Request

### The Process

1.  Commit your changes with clear, conventional messages.
2.  Push your branch to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin feat/your-cool-new-feature`
3.  Go to the main ChittChat repository and you will see a prompt to open a Pull Request from your new branch.

### Using the Pull Request Template

Please fill out the Pull Request template provided. It helps us understand your changes at a glance.

> üí° **Pro-Tip:** A great PR description includes a "before" and "after" screenshot or a short screen recording (Loom is great for this).

### What to Expect During a Review

A project maintainer will review your PR.
* We may ask questions or request changes. This is a normal and healthy part of the contribution process!
* Once your PR is approved and all checks have passed, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch.
* üéâ Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution!
